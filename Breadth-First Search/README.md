# Breadth-First Search

This program runs a [Breadth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) algorithm on an undirected graph. The end result of script execution is a ".png" image of a possible representation of the final graph structure (vertices and edges).

> Some parts of the code are methods and attributes already implemented to solve the problem of coloring a graph. These parts do not interfere and are not directly used in this release.

**The code of this repository depends on the [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org) library to run.**
