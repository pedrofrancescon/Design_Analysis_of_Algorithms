# Dijkstra

This program executes the [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) algorithm in a graph. The final result of the script execution is a ".png" image of a possible representation of the final graph structure (vertices and edges), indicating the shortest path found by the algorithm.
